# antoniole01_0pixelpaint



NOTE:: I still don't know how to use GITHUB. Right now I have code setup like this. And I call them from my brun.bat, main.cpp and defines.h.
NOTE:: I also bought a new computer. So dependencies need to be updated from x32 to x64



// NOTE:: How I have my program setup
// Dependencies
c:\z\bin

// subfiles     // NOTE: Just code i use a lot. And didn't want to retype everytime. //xx BAD IDEA THOUGH xx//
c:\z\cpp\sdl\_MI

// my main file
c:\z\cpp\sdl\0_pixelpaint\main.cpp
c:\z\cpp\sdl\0_pixelpaint\brun.bat
c:\z\cpp\sdl\0_pixelpaint\build\
